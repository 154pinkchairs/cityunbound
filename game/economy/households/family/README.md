# Families & Persons

## Philosophy

* Not only the exchange of physical goods influences the decision-making of families, but intangible psychological, physiological, social metrics play an equally if not more important role
* There is no central happiness metric, but only individual diverse motivations that vary both over time as well as from person to person - one can only get a rough overview of "how well someone is doing" by looking at all of them
